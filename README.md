# Machine Unlearning in Small Language Models

This project explores **Machine Unlearning** in small language models (SLMs) to address ethical, privacy, and legal challenges.

## Project Overview

### Objective
- Enable selective unlearning of sensitive or outdated information in language models.
- Minimize the computational cost of retraining while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.
